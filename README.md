# StuckInSpace
A tiny game project made with the library Gosu, in Ruby language. It was my first project in college so pardon me for the ugly code :D

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/hayssac/StuckInSpace
cd StuckInSpace
ruby 001play.rb
```

### MacOS deps
```
brew install sdl2
sudo gem install gosu
```
